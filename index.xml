      <description>Merry Christmas everyone. In the past two weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work relaxing, eating cookies, and doing other Christmas activities. I hope Santa was kind to you all.
I do have an update as per my development. I am still not ready to announce anything, but I have been working on some software for the past 2 weeks in my spare time along with another developer. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to announce it by February.</description>

      <description>Hello whoever is reading this! This is my first post on my blog ever. Perhaps no one will ever read these posts, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine! I&amp;rsquo;m writing these to have a nice public journal of my efforts in game and software development.
I won&amp;rsquo;t announce what I&amp;rsquo;m making yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting started. I have 1 game and 1 piece of software I&amp;rsquo;m planning to develop over the coming months.</description>
